This document provides high-level documentation on testing the latest changes to Budgie Desktop. Whenever possible, we recommend that when
[reporting an issue](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/issues) with Budgie Desktop that you first test with the latest available version of Budgie Desktop, if not the latest in-development changes,
to see if the issue is already resolved.

Please look at our [GitHub releases](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/releases) to confirm the latest version. You can compare this against the version you have installed by running:

```bash
budgie-desktop --version
```

## Git Builds

Some distros provide up-to-date "git" versions of each component. If possible please try these packages on a separate machine / in a virtual machine.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Arch" value="Arch">
    Arch Linux typically has the latest stable version in the Community repository. You can test with the latest git
    master of Budgie by installing the [budgie-desktop-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/budgie-desktop-git) 
    AUR package using an AUR helper like [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) or [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru). Make sure to update your system before installing budgie-desktop-git, and reinstall the official budgie-desktop package
    once you have finished testing.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Ubuntu" value="ubuntu">
    Ubuntu provides a [daily built PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntubudgie-dev/+archive/ubuntu/budgie-desktop-test)
    based on the latest available stable release - LTS releases are not necessarily the latest stable.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntubudgie-dev/budgie-desktop-test
sudo apt-get update
reboot --
```

    To remove the PPA and return to the distro provided package, run:

```bash
sudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntubudgie-dev/budgie-desktop-test
reboot --
```

For other distributions than those listed above, you will need to follow the steps at [Building Budgie Desktop](/developer/workflow/building-budgie-desktop).

## Testing

There are several components that you may encounter throughout usage or testing of Budgie Desktop.

| Name                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                   | Supports `--replace` |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| budgie-daemon           | Budgie Daemon is a background process responsible for many activities such as notification handling, XDG Directory monitorying, screenshot invoking, tab switching, and more. | ✅                   |
| budgie-desktop-settings | Budgie Desktop Settings is the graphical application for configuration of our desktop environment.                                                                            | ❌                   |
| budgie-panel            | This component handles one of more visual panels, which includes Raven and panel applets.                                                                                     | ✅                   |
| budgie-wm               | Budgie WM is our window manager that sits as a Meta "plugin" on top of [Mutter](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter).                                                       | ✅                   |

### Restarting components

It is common when testing Budgie Desktop to restart various components. When doing so, the `--replace` flag is passed alongside `&!` at the end of the command. This allows you to detach from the process
without it stopping, so you can for example close the Terminal.

Full example:

```
budgie-panel --replace &!
```

Some may opt to use the `nohup` (no hangup) command to log the output as well. If you do not need to do any long-term logging, it is not necessary to run it with nohup. Below is an example of how you would use it with budgie-panel:

```
nohup budgie-panel --replace > budgie-panel.out
```

This will output to the file named `budgie-panel.out` in whichever directory you run the command. You can change the filename should you desire.

:::info
Some components may be more sensitive to replacing and may either need to be done in a specific order, or twice (common with budgie-daemon).

When in doubt, you should:

1. Do a double replace of budgie-daemon
2. If you are replacing both budgie-daemon and budgie-panel, first replace then daemon, then replace panel.
